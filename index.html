<h1> HIMI Paint! </h1>

    	These are HIMI Paints. They are gouache, water-based paints that I purchased recently from Amazon. Each color is individually wrapped and sealed upon receiving the paints, and they are housed in a blue plastic box. I am still learning the technique of properly using these paints, as I am more familiar with using alcohol-based markers in my own work. The container has 18 paints that are meant to be opened, dried out, and reactivated with water. Their packaging is quote satisfying to me, because despite the inherent messiness of the paint itself, it keeps each section contained and divided with the plastic container and individually-wrapped pockets of paints. I do question its sustainability as a result.
